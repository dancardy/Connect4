This project implements an AI that plays Connect 4 against a user.
Load `index.html` to play.  

Visual Studio files are included in the repository for convenience, but
they can be ignored.  Only the TypeScript (.ts) files affect the game's behavior.

The game can be played at [https://www.cardy.net/projects/connect4](https://www.cardy.net/projects/connect4).
