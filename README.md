This project implements an AI that plays Connect 4 against a user.
The game can be played by loading `index.html`.

Visual Studio files are included in the repository for convenience,
they can be ignored.  Only the TypeScript (.ts) files affect the game's behavior.

This project is hosted at [https://www.cardy.net/projects/connect4](https://www.cardy.net/projects/connect4).
